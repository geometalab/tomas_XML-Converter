# tomas_XML-Converter
Converts TOMAS-xml-files to csv-files.
## How to use the script
*Note: Your Python version needs to be 3 or higher.*
- Put your xml-file (UTF-8 or UTF-8 BOM) in the same directory in which the script ```tomasConverter.py``` is.
- The script needs options and arguments to do its work.
- If you simply run the script without any options or with -? or --help, you'll see how to use it correctly.
- After the conversion is complete, a new csv-file will be created.
